# Meeting Advice
1. Meetings should always start on time.
2. Meetings should end 5 minutes before the next meeting.
3. Nobody should be on any device during a meeting unless it is to display something to everyone in the room.
4. All meetings need agendas. Any meeting that starts without an agenda should have everyone leave.
5. All meetings end in action items. An action item cannot be just "another meeting".
6. All meetings should have a leader responsible for following these rules.
