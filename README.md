This is a collection of resources and explanations I have created and collected over time to assist in Computer Science education and career development.

Hopefully this can become something similar to these incredible resources:

[Hyper-Math](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hmat.html)

Please enjoy!
