This is a collection of resources and explanations I have created, coallated, and collected over time to assist in my Computer Science education and career in development.

Many people have shared with me, and I am sharing with you.

Apologies for the lack of credits.

Eventually I hope to create something simliar to the following incredible resources:

[Hyper-Physics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html)

[Hyper-Math](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hmat.html)

Please enjoy!

P.S.
I gathered all this myself and it has not been reviewed for mistakes, so please use your judgement.
