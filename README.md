This is a collection of resources and explanations I have created and collected over time to assist in Computer Science education and career development.

Eventually I hope to create something similar to the following incredible resources:

[Hyper-Physics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html)

[Hyper-Math](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hmat.html)

Please enjoy!

P.S. This has not been reviewed for mistakes, so please use your judgement.
