# resume

WHAT HOW WHY for resume bullet points
DENSE - intimidating
what tech, used to solve what problem

- tech skills, work experience, projects, talks, education, interests (highly specific, what gym, type),
- non technical points are not worth including

- credibility signal - we are a good engineer
- personalized in - msg for them to make them feel good
- call to action - let's meet, logistics
- overall style

personalized in - history and background (previous engineering team of employees)
look at leadership, if they were at fb, maybe they used double blind code reviews

# double down with follow up email on same day, to engineering leadership

## 4-5 days later, followup email to same address as double down

apply linkedin/company, angelsit, add message, double down, follow up

# goal of recruiter

- impress thheir boss, vp of engineering

# whiteboarding

- quadrant strategy
- find duplicate characters
  q1 top left, - inputs and outputs, consider edge cases, data cleansing, spaces, caps, etc., getting the perimeter included cases
  part of the goal is to get talking and get comfortable, display knowledge, verbalizing

q2, bottom left - psuedo diagram, start thinking about how you would solve it, asses time and memory complexity
can list both brute force and optimized

q3 top right - psuedo code first, then functional code
q4, bottom right - run code on a given input
